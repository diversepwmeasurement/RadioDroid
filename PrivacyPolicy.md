Welcome to RadioDroid! We are committed to protecting the privacy of our users. This Privacy Policy outlines how we handle and protect your information while you use RadioDroid.

## Introduction

RadioDroid is an open-source Android application designed to play radio streams. We prioritize the privacy of our users, and in alignment with that, this app does not collect, store, or share any personal data.

## Data We Don't Collect

We do not collect, store, or process any personal data when you use RadioDroid. Our primary function is to play radio streams, and for that, we donâ€™t need to access or store any personal information from you.

## Permissions

The app might require certain device permissions to function optimally, like [e.g., "internet access" for streaming]. These permissions do not involve accessing personal data, and are only in place to ensure the app functions as intended.

## Open Source Nature

As an open-source project, the source code of RadioDroid is available for public view at [https://github.com/segler-alex/RadioDroid]. This ensures a transparent operation where you can review the codebase to understand how the app functions.

## Links to Other Websites

Our app may contain links to other websites, for instance, radio websites or related resources. Note that these third-party websites are not operated by us, so we advise you to review the Privacy Policy of these websites. We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party websites or services.
